        <h3><b>St Peter's Basilica</b></h3>
        <p style="color: white;">St. Peter’s Basilica, present basilica of St. Peter in Vatican City (an enclave in Rome), begun by Pope Julius II in 1506 and completed in 1615 under Paul V. It is designed as a three-aisled Latin cross with a dome at the crossing, directly above the high altar, which covers the shrine of St. Peter the Apostle. St. Peter’s Basilica is one of the most renowned works of Renaissance architecture and features many notable Baroque elements. It is often regarded as the greatest building of its age.
            The edifice—the church of the popes—is a major pilgrimage site. Frequently drawing crowds of tens of thousands of Catholics, both the basilica and its adjoining St. Peter’s Square are used for a number of liturgies presided over by the pope throughout the year. Together with the Basilica of St. John Lateran (San Giovanni in Laterano), the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, and the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls (all three of which are in Rome), St. Peter’s Basilica is one of only four churches in the world that hold the rank of major basilica. Until 1989 St. Peter’s was the largest church in Christendom. In that year it was exceeded in size by the newly built basilica in Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
